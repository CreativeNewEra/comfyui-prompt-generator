# Personas - AI Conversation Styles for Prompt Generation

## What Are Personas?

Personas are different AI conversation styles designed to help you create image prompts in different ways. Instead of using dropdown menus with 80+ presets, you can have a natural conversation with an AI personality that guides you through creating your image idea.

Think of personas as different creative partners, each with their own approach:

- **Beginners** get patient, step-by-step guidance
- **Power users** get technical control with weights and syntax
- **Professionals** get commercial-focused creative direction
- **Storytellers** get narrative-rich world-building

## Available Personas

### üé® Creative Vision Guide
**Best for:** Beginners, vague ideas, creative exploration

**What it does:**
Patiently builds your image idea step-by-step through simple questions. Perfect if you feel overwhelmed by too many choices or just have a vague idea like "something with a dragon."

**Approach:**
- Asks one or two questions at a time
- Summarizes the scene as you build it together
- Never presents multiple options (builds, doesn't list)
- Warm and encouraging tone

**Example Conversation:**
```
You: "I want to make a picture of a cat."
Persona: "A cat! A perfect subject. To get us started, where is this cat?
          Are we imagining them cozy indoors, or outside exploring?"

You: "Indoors."
Persona: "Great, a cozy indoor scene. What's the cat doing? Are they
          peacefully sleeping, or maybe staring intently out a window?"
```

**Output:** Final scene description (not a technical prompt)

magic being awakened.

He seeks to resurrect the one person he couldn't save, but in doing so, may
unleash something far worse than death.
